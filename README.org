* compression-cache

** Motivation

To provide a simple protocol for caching compressed files.

Goal: Make a Compression of Static Files for Web Servers

** Usage

There are two functions as of version =0.1.0=.

#+BEGIN_SRC
(defun initialize-cache (cache-path))
(defun ensure-path-to-compressed-file (filepath &optional &key (algorithm :gzip)))
#+END_SRC

The function =initialize-cache= must be called with a path to store the files to be cached.

The function =ensure-path-to-compressed-file= will return a path to the compressed version of the file which was passed as input.
